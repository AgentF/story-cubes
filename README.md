###About the app

I was inspired to do an StoryCubes app when I heard of the game's idea and how that can help you stimulate your creativity and storytelling.

Obviusly this is a very open and creative game and with just the dices works but my aim is implementing various game modes, a quick story mode where you write a short story (140-280char) in a short period of time (3-5min), a collaborative mode where each participant make only a part of the history and the next begins from there.

I choose to keep it just html, css and vanilla js as long as it works, maybe in the future I'll redo it with React.js
